For this project my vision was to tell a story about an alien invasion from the perspective of a college student.
I envisioned the aliens communicating through music, interrupting electronic devices to communicate their messages.
I would like to add a few more recordings to my project in the next version, including the alien music and recording for the ENS alert.
I also want to try editing the broadcasts to sound more like a TV broadcast. The version right now conveys the overall story but doesn't flow well and needs fixed up in the next draft.
